### welcome to my page -



I am from Kolkata, a city in India. I grew up in a joint family. I graduated from the [West Bengal University of Technology](https://makautwb.ac.in/) with a major in Information Technology and most part of my education was completed in the same city.

I started my career with [CMC Limited](http://cmcltd.com/) in Mumbai and used to work on C++ and C for a major Stock Exchange as a Backend Developer. Later I moved to [Accenture Solution Private Limited](https://www.accenture.com/in-en) where I moved from Mumbai to Pune to Bangalore to Kolkata on multiple assignments and projects working as Analyst and Senior Analyst spending most of my times thinking and creating solutions with Python, Shell scripting on Clouds using hacks like Flask, Regex, and so many tools/open source softwares like Vault, Chef, Ansible, Rancher, Kubernetes, Docker, Nagios, Spacewalk to name a few. I love automating simple things to keep my life easy.

I am now in Toronto working with [Accenture Inc](https://www.accenture.com/ca-en) as a Senior Consultant.

I love my job, as I get to work on many of the latest technologies and tools on multiple cloud providers like AWS, MS Azure, GCP, AliBaba Cloud. My latest stint is with and around Kubernetes and I get to experiment with many open-source tools.
