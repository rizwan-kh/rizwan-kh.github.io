This is generally not a very usual use case or operation. However, we were able to achieve it using the below pipeline.
Assuming, your pipeline has completed and has generated or modified the files, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to push the changes to git - this surely will trigger another pipeline, however, this second pipeline will start the deployment and not the generation of terraform files as it did in the first pipeline trigger.</description></item></channel></rss>
