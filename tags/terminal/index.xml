It helps switch between multiple programs in one terminal, detach them(they keep running in the background) and reattach them when needed. I started using tmux as someone recommended me to start using it as it helps with CKA &amp;amp; CKAD (which I have still not attempted) and then later on I was heavily using it for my website(with Hugo). I had previously used mPutty, but mPutty uses multiple logged-in sessions to display on the screen, whereas tmux simply multiplies the existing sessions on screen.</description></item></channel></rss>
