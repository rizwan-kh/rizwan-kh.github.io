It&amp;rsquo;s an Aqua Security open-source project that can be easily used to integrate with our existing CI CD pipeline or used as a stand-alone tool to scan container images deployed on the Kubernetes cluster.
We were using Clair previous to our switch to Trivy as we analyzed both the tools and found Trivy to be more helpful for the longer run - it was faster, had more CVE database updates as compared to Clair and didn&amp;rsquo;t depend on external clients to interact/scan.</description></item><item><title>Docker Vulnerability Analysis</title><link>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2020/09/docker-vulnerability-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 17:20:44 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2020/09/docker-vulnerability-analysis/</guid><description>Introduction Docker, a powerful containerization platform, has revolutionized the way applications are developed, shipped, deployed and consumed. However, as with any technology, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to address security considerations. Conducting vulnerability analysis on your Docker containers is an essential step in ensuring the integrity and security of your applications as well as environment.
Why Vulnerability Analysis? Containerized applications, while providing isolation, share the same kernel and may carry vulnerabilities. Regular vulnerability analysis helps identify and mitigate potential security risks within your Docker images.</description></item><item><title>Klar</title><link>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2020/03/klar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 17:20:26 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2020/03/klar/</guid><description>Introduction Klar is a static binary tool to analyze images stored in a private or public Docker registry for security vulnerabilities using Clair. Klar is designed to be used as an integration tool so it relies on environment variables. It&amp;rsquo;s a single binary which requires no dependencies and can be plugged and/or integrated into our CI CD pipelines.
Klar serves as a client which coordinates the image checks between the Docker registry and Clair.</description></item></channel></rss>
