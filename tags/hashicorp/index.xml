The default token authentication is always enabled.
Configuration There are two configurations that we had to do to achieve this with Azure AD, one is for app registration in the Azure Portal and the other one is on Vault - enabling the OIDC based auth. The steps for both are described below.</description></item><item><title>Vagrant</title><link>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2020/03/vagrant/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 17:20:26 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2020/03/vagrant/</guid><description>Introduction Getting started with Vagrant Download the install the Vagrant from the Download section
vagrant version Installed Version: 2.2.10 Latest Version: 2.2.10 You&amp;#39;re running an up-to-date version of Vagrant! Download and install VirtualBox
Now if both Vagrant and VirtualBox are up and running, all we need to do is run the below 3 commands to have a Ubuntu VM up and available for our use in no time.
vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64 vagrant up vagrant ssh This is a pretty simple way to spin up a new Ubuntu VM, we can do a lot more which I will try to write up in later posts.</description></item></channel></rss>
