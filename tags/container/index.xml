It&amp;rsquo;s an Aqua Security open source project that can be easily used to integrate with our existing CI CD pipeline or used as an stand alone tool to scan container images deployed on Kubernetes cluster.
We were using Clair previous to our switch to Trivy as we analyzed both the tools and found Trivy to be more helpful for the longer run - it was faster, had more CVE database updates as compared to Clair and didn&amp;rsquo;t depend on external clients to interact/scan.</description></item></channel></rss>
