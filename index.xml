      <description>Introduction If you&amp;rsquo;ve been using Azure DevOps, you would know that a pipeline can be trigger with runtime parameters in the format key: value pair and this is great for doing almost all of the tasks.
For our use-case, we had been looking at option to send a JSON based parameter dictionary and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any way at the time of writing this article. We came up with a hack to achieve this and I would want to write it up in this blog post.</description>

      <description>Hugo and Github Account A small write-up on how this site was setup. There are plenty of materials available all over the internet, but this is more of a self-help document for myself to refer back in future to understand how this was all setup.
 Hugo can be downloaded from their official release page A GitHub account needs to be created from this link and a public repo is required to be setup here  After installing Hugo, to generate a new site, run the below command:</description>

      <description>Introduction Klar is a static binary tool to analyze images stored in a private or public Docker registry for security vulnerabilities using Clair. Klar is designed to be used as an integration tool so it relies on environment variables. It&amp;rsquo;s a single binary which requires no dependencies and can be plugged and/or integrated into our CI CD pipelines.
Klar serves as a client which coordinates the image checks between the Docker registry and Clair.</description>

      <description>Introduction  Getting started with Vagrant Download the install the Vagrant from the Download section
vagrant version Installed Version: 2.2.10 Latest Version: 2.2.10 You&#39;re running an up-to-date version of Vagrant! Download and install VirtualBox
Now if both Vagrant and VirtualBox are up and running, all we need to do is run the below 3 commands to have a Ubuntu VM up and available for our use in no time.
vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64 vagrant up vagrant ssh This is a pretty simple way to spin up a new Ubuntu VM, we can do a lot more which I will try to write up in later posts.</description>

      <title>Gitlab CI &amp; Kaniko to build Docker Images</title>

      <guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2020/02/gitlab-ci-kaniko-to-build-docker-images/</guid>
      <description>Introduction You can build container images from a Dockerfile inside a container or a Kubernetes cluster, though J√©r√¥me Petazzoni strongly discourages from doing so. He wrote a detailed blog that can be read here on why not to build container images using Dockerfile inside a container or a Kubernetes cluster.
 Context You will get N number of blogs on how to use the CI/CD of GitLab; here we will see an easy reference point to extend a file and create CI/CD for Docker Image to be built and stored in the same GitLab registry using kaniko.</description>

      <title>How to use service accounts for Kubernetes imagePullSecrets</title>

      <guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2020/01/how-to-use-service-accounts-for-kubernetes-imagepullsecrets/</guid>
      <description>What are Service Accounts in Kubernetes? As per Kubernetes.io - A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod.
One can think of service accounts as service users for pods. They help pods authenticate with the api-server and interact with it.
 Many times, we come across a situation where our organization uses a private Docker registry to store the Docker images and to make this available we need to create a docker-registry kubernetes secret and pass as imagePullSecrets in the deployment manifest.</description>

      <description>Below are few of the main and basic commands used in Docker, an easy pick-up and good-to-go command page for docker troubleshooting.
Alias  If you are a lazy developer/sysadmin like me, the first thing you should do on your system is to make easy alias of all the long commands, below are the ones I often use on any system I use on a daily basis:
These can be imported on ~/.</description>

      <description>tmux - Terminal Multiplexer tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It helps switch between multiple programs in one terminal, detach them(they keep running in background) and reattach when needed. I started using tmux as someone recommended me to start using it as it helps with CKA &amp;amp; CKAD (which I have still not attempted) and then later on I was heavily using it for my website(with Hugo). I had previously used mPutty, but mPutty uses mutliple logged in sessions to display on screen, whereas tmux simply multiply the existing sessions on screen.</description>
