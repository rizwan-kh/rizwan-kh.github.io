I suggested below two approaches
map custom-nginx.conf as a configmap in the pod restart/reload nginx process We went ahead with the second approach as it was the more time-saving option.</description></item><item><title>Working with dead container</title><link>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2022/07/working-with-dead-container/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 19:39:13 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2022/07/working-with-dead-container/</guid><description>I came across this question from a team member where they wanted to troubleshoot a dead container. I use the below process and I thought why not do a small write up to help wider audience.
Usage Process is very simple - to save/commit the dead container to a new image and then start a new container with a sh entrypoint and debug the container. I consider you&amp;rsquo;re using docker, although similar equivalent commands for other container runtime alternatives like podman, ctr, etc.</description></item><item><title>Integration of Azure AD as OIDC identity provider for Kubernetes</title><link>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2022/03/integration-of-azure-ad-as-oidc-identity-provider-for-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 18:23:08 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2022/03/integration-of-azure-ad-as-oidc-identity-provider-for-kubernetes/</guid><description>Introduction In my project, we are using many flavors of Kubernetes viz. EKS, AKS, GKE, RKE, ACK. RBAC for all these clusters is managed via a central Active Directory as well as the user authentication, and this is achieved centrally by onboarding all the clusters on Rancher to manage all Kubernetes clusters.
I had a requirement where we couldn&amp;rsquo;t onboard the users to our Active Directory, and the plan was to give them access to the Kubernetes cluster via Azure AD external users(or guest users).</description></item><item><title>Hashicorp Vault &amp; Azure AD Identity Integration</title><link>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2022/02/hashicorp-vault-azure-ad-identity-integration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 19:31:58 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2022/02/hashicorp-vault-azure-ad-identity-integration/</guid><description>Introduction In this post, we will be implementing Hashicorp Vault authentication with Microsoft Azure AD as an identity provider using OIDC(OpenID Connect). The default token authentication is always enabled.
Configuration There are two configurations that we had to do to achieve this with Azure AD, one is for app registration in the Azure Portal and the other one is on Vault - enabling the OIDC based auth. Steps for both are described below.</description></item><item><title>Integration of Azure AD as OIDC identity provider for AWS EKS</title><link>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2021/12/integration-of-azure-ad-as-oidc-identity-provider-for-aws-eks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 23:40:21 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2021/12/integration-of-azure-ad-as-oidc-identity-provider-for-aws-eks/</guid><description>Introduction In my project we are using many flavours of Kubernetes viz.

It&amp;rsquo;s an Aqua Security open source project that can be easily used to integrate with our existing CI CD pipeline or used as an stand alone tool to scan container images deployed on Kubernetes cluster.
We were using Clair previous to our switch to Trivy as we analyzed both the tools and found Trivy to be more helpful for the longer run - it was faster, had more CVE database updates as compared to Clair and didn&amp;rsquo;t depend on external clients to interact/scan.</description></item><item><title>Traefik on Kubernetes with Let's Encrypt &amp; Route53</title><link>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2021/07/traefik-on-kubernetes-with-lets-encrypt-route53/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 17:40:27 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2021/07/traefik-on-kubernetes-with-lets-encrypt-route53/</guid><description>Why Traefik? Traefik is a modern dynamic load balancer and reverse proxy, its easy to setup, control and provides lots of options which sits right with our use-cases. It integrates with Lets Encrypt to provide SSL termination along with support for service discovery, tracing, metrics out of the box running on Kubernetes as a small pod.
Since when We have been using Traefik since early 2017 on 2 of our cluster as a daemonset Kubernetes object with externalDNS to update the worker nodes IP with our DNS provider and used to manually generate and update Lets Encrypt certificate on a Kubernetes secret object.</description></item><item><title>(Azure DevOps) Send Json Request(Parameters) to Azure Pipelines</title><link>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2021/06/azure-devops-send-json-requestparameters-to-azure-pipelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 11:16:23 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/posts/2021/06/azure-devops-send-json-requestparameters-to-azure-pipelines/</guid><description>Introduction If you&amp;rsquo;ve been using Azure DevOps, you would know that a pipeline can be trigger with runtime parameters in the format key: value pair and this is great for doing almost all of the tasks.
For our use-case, we had been looking at option to send a JSON based parameter dictionary and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any way at the time of writing this article. We came up with a hack to achieve this and I would want to write it up in this blog post.</description></item><item><title>I am Rizwan Khan;</title><link>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:44:33 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://rizwan-kh.github.io/about/</guid><description>welcome to my page - I am from Kolkata, a city in India.

There are plenty of materials available all over the internet, but this is more of a self-help document for myself to refer back in future to understand how this was all setup.
Hugo can be downloaded from their official release page A GitHub account needs to be created from this link and a public repo is required to be setup here After installing Hugo, to generate a new site, run the below command:</description></item></channel></rss>
